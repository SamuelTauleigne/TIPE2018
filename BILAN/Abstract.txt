Shared bikes enable people to use bikes through a city without all the troubles that could occur. However, it is interesting to study the availablility of bikes some days at some stations. So I built a database gathering some information and measures about the numbers of bikes and stands available at every station three times a day for 8 months. The database aims at predicting the availability of bikes or stands at every station at any time. Thus, I compare some predicitive models based on statistics which are more or less effective depending on the horizon of prediction.
